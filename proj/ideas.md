- Soundboard with AI (AI: For generating tts)

## Discussion

Right now all displayed elements look skewed. If there are only a few sound files, the system buttons look out of place. I might fix this with absolute positioning, yet this will impede how many sound files can be displayed at one time. I could make a page system, keep adjustable fonts, and have to use math formulas for button placement.

## Known Bugs

- When you have a large amount of sound files in the soundboard, remove them then reload, the layout of the soundboard is skewed and elements are not placed correctly.
